# Supported browser

We will not fall into the trap that everything needs to look the same in every browser. It needs to provide the same functionality in all browsers if we can help it.

At client.corp we [support](#support) the following browsers:
## Desktop
### Grade A
- [Google chrome](https://www.google.nl/chrome/index.html)
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/new/)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/nl-nl/HT204416)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/windows/microsoft-edge)
(most recent versions)

### Grade B
- all of the above, one version back.
- [Internet Explorer 11](https://www.microsoft.com/nl-nl/download/internet-explorer-11-for-windows-7-details.aspx)

### Grad C
Everything else.

<h3 id="support">Support</h3>
We have a couple levels of support. These are roughly based on the work done by [yahoo](https://github.com/yui/yui3/wiki/Graded-Browser-Support) in the past.

#### Grade A
The highest level, all functionality will be tested in these browsers. No bugs are allowed. But we are aware of the fact that all browsers are different.

#### Grade B
All our stuff in tested, small presentational differences are to be expected. Main functionality is expected to work.

#### Grade C
If bugs are reported in these browsers, we don't actively test in these, we will look at them at a case by case basis. Most we expect to fix if the amount of people experiencing this bug is significant enough.
